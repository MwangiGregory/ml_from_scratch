# ml_from_scratch
A project where I am learning about machine learning from scratch and without any libraries using JavaScript.

First project: I am building a data collection app. It consists of a drawing canvas that prompts users to draw certain things. The web app then saves the data to a json file in the local file system of the user's device.
